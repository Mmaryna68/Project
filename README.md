## Functionality and Site Description
The project was created by the team on the request of the client as part of practical work in the IT Girls school. The layout used for the development was also designed by the project team.

## Project goals included:

Creating a single-page portfolio website for a consulting business, offering services such as business plans, financial models, and business processes. The target audience was large companies with an annual turnover of over 450 million rubles (not individuals or sole proprietors).
The approximate website structure was planned to be:
Introduction
About the Owner
Mission
Services Provided
Collaboration Process
Industry Experience
Uniqueness
Contact Information
The client provided desired color schemes and a rough layout structure, according to which the team developed the layout and subsequently implemented the website layout in line with the design from the layout.
The website should be responsive and look good on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
User interaction is implemented through a contact form.
